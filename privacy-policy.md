This Privacy Policy explains how **Globy** (“we”, “us”, “our”) processes information in the Globy iOS app.

## Who we are
Globy is a mobile app for tracking visited places and trips on iOS. We don’t run our own backend that stores your personal data. Most data stays on your device and only selected events are shared with third-party providers to enable in-app purchases and maps.

Contact: [support@globy.app](mailto:support@globy.app)

## Data we process

### 1) Purchases & subscriptions (required for paid features)
- **What**: product identifiers, transaction/receipt data, subscription status, device/app metadata needed for purchase validation.
- **Source/Processors**: **Apple (StoreKit)** and **Adapty**.
- **Why**: to sell products, validate receipts, restore purchases, determine your access level, and get aggregate monetization analytics.
- **Where**: sent to Apple/Adapty; not stored on our own servers.

### 2) Location (only with your permission)
- **What**: precise device location needed to build trip timelines and visited places.
- **Processing**: stored **locally on your device**. Not sent to our servers.
- **Geocoding**: to convert coordinates ↔︎ place names we may use **Apple (MapKit)**

### 3) Photos metadata (only with your permission)
- **What**: date/time and location metadata of items in your Photos library (we do **not** read image content).
- **Why**: to suggest trips and visited places.
- **Where**: processed on device; not uploaded to our servers.

### 4) Diagnostics & crash data (optional, aggregate)
- **What**: anonymized/aggregated crash and performance data.
- **Source**: Apple’s diagnostics.
- **Why**: to improve stability and features.

We do **not** sell your data. We do **not** collect your name, email, or other contact details unless you contact us.
