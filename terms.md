By downloading or using **Globy** (the “App”), you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before using the App.

## 1. License & Intellectual Property
We grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App on iOS devices you own or control, in accordance with these Terms and Apple’s policies.  
The App, including all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights, remains the property of Globy or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, translate, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works from, or attempt to extract the source code of the App, except where permitted by applicable law.

## 2. Changes to the App & Fees
We may improve or change the App over time and, if needed, charge for certain features or services. We will always make it clear what you are paying for before any charge is applied.

## 3. Privacy
Your use of the App is also governed by our **[Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/)**, which explains what data may be processed and how. Please review it.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App may rely on third-party services (e.g., Apple/StoreKit for purchases, Adapty for subscription infrastructure, map and geocoding providers). These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies, and they may receive or process data necessary to provide their functionality.

## 5. Connectivity, Data Charges & Device Responsibility
Some functions require an active internet connection. We are not responsible if the App does not function fully without connectivity.  
If you use the App outside Wi-Fi, your mobile provider’s terms may apply and you may incur data charges (including roaming). If you are not the bill payer, you confirm you have permission to use the App.  
Keep your device secure and charged. Jailbreaking/rooting may compromise security and the App may not work properly or at all.

## 6. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions
- **Billing via Apple.** Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple (StoreKit). Payment is charged to your Apple ID upon confirmation.  
- **Auto-renewal.** Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least **24 hours** before the end of the current period. Your account may be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.  
- **Manage/cancel.** Manage or cancel in **Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**. Deleting the App does not cancel an active subscription.  
- **Trials & intro offers.** If offered, trials or introductory prices convert to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial/intro period ends. Any unused trial portion may be forfeited upon purchase.  
- **Price changes.** Subscription prices may change. Where required, Apple will notify you and may seek consent; otherwise you can cancel before renewal.  
- **Restore.** You can restore purchases on devices signed in with the same Apple ID.

## 7. Refunds
Refunds for in-app purchases are handled by Apple under App Store policies (e.g., via Apple’s “Report a Problem”). We do not issue refunds directly.

## 8. Acceptable Use
You agree not to misuse the App, interfere with its operation, violate applicable laws or third-party rights, deploy malware, scrape or harvest data, or attempt unauthorized access.

## 9. Updates & Termination
We may provide updates that you may need to install to continue using the App. We may suspend or discontinue the App, or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or where required by law. Upon termination, your right to use the App ends and you must stop using it (and delete it if requested).

## 10. Disclaimers
The App is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages; loss of data; or loss of profits arising from your use of the App. Nothing in these Terms limits rights that cannot be limited under applicable consumer law.

## 12. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
